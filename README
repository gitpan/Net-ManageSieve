This module implements the ManageSieve protocol as described in
http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-martin-managesieve-09.txt

It does not by itself provides Sieve mechanisms, but lets you
transfer your Sieve scripts to/from the server and manage them.

Supported are SASL (authentification) and STARTTLS (encryption).

In order to test the ManageSieve commands, you need to update the file
managesieve-test-account (see managesieve-test-account.sample) and fill
in the host and account data to connect to / with.

The implementation has been influenced by Net::Cmd a lot, however,
its inability of doing TLS forced me to roll my own.
